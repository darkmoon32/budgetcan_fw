# budgetcan_fw

Firmware to support gs_usb on most SMT32 devices.  The board specific cose can be autogenerated by CubeMX and copied over to your own directory in the ./Poartable directory.

The goal of this project was to create a stable foundation for gs_usb while allowing developers to create custom software to support their boards.
 
 The core functionality is in the ./Core directory and all the custom code for each board is in the ./Portable directory.
 
 Using this driver you can create your own custom boards while utlizing the gs_usb core.  
 
 Core functionality includes:
 - USB connectivity to the gs_usb driver as implemented in the Linux kernel (support is currently matching kernel 6.1rc1 but is backwards compatible with all pervious kernels that support gs_usb).
 - Support for bxCAN (STMF0, STMF4, etc.)
 - Support for FDCAN (STMG0, STMG4, STMH7, STML5, STMU5)
 - Support for LIN (using any UART available on the STM32)
 
 Since the core codebase uses FreeRTOS you can create your own tasks/timers/queues/etc as needed to develop custom features for your board.
 
 I will include a video soon on the process of creating a board from scratch.
