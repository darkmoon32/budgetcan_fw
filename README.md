# budgetcan_fw

Firmware to support gs_usb on most SMT32 devices.  The board specific code can be autogenerated by CubeMX and copied over to your own directory in the ./Portable directory.

The goal of this project was to create a stable foundation for gs_usb while allowing developers to create custom software to support their boards.
 
 The core functionality is in the ./Core directory and all the custom code for each board is in the ./Portable directory.
 
 Using this driver you can create your own custom boards while utlizing the gs_usb core.  
 
 Core functionality includes:
 - USB connectivity to the gs_usb driver as implemented in the Linux kernel (support is currently matching kernel 6.1rc1 but is backwards compatible with all pervious kernels that support gs_usb).  This functinality is maintained as stable even as the developer creates custom code.
 - Support for bxCAN (STMF0, STMF4, etc.)
 - Support for FDCAN (STMG0, STMG4, STMH7, STML5, STMU5)
 - Support for LIN (using any UART available on the STM32)
 - Support for the custom code to take action on messages received on the bus or transmitted by the host.  The developer can also inject messages onto the bus in an adhoc manner based on their own custom code (e.g. a GPIO triggers the transmission of a message on the CAN bus or triggers a message back to the host).
 
 Since the core codebase uses FreeRTOS you can create your own tasks/timers/queues/etc as needed to develop custom features for your board.
 
 I will include a video soon on the process of creating a board from scratch.
